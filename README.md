## About this Project

In our Front-end Coding Bootcamp with the University of Birmingham, we were tasked with creating a group project by deploying the use of 2 APIs. So we came up with the idea of Recipe Rescue - a recipe inspiration website that serves users any healthy recipes they want by searching our recipe catalogue.

## Project User Story

As a group of Front-end developers, we want to design and build a recipe inspiration application that serves up healthy recipes that a user wants via 2 different APIs.

## Project Acceptance Critaria

Our Recipe Rescue application should be able to:

1. Generate healthy meal recipes via the Edamam recipe API, when users search for it. E.g if a user searches for the keyword "egg", various egg recipes will pop up.

2. Display recipes via a modal pop up for the user to choose from.

## Project Rough Ideas

How our Recipe Rescue application came together:

- Header design by Vasile

- Inital website design in Figma by Farah and Salma

- Adding team collaboration in Github by Ola

## Features and Functionality of Recipe Rescue

Our application is a recipe inspiration website and we wanted to offer users the ability to get healthy recipes quickly and easily.

- Recipe Search Bar in middle of the homepage taking center stage:

Even though each of us still have varying knowledge gaps, we happily shared ideas and contributed to making our application Recipe Rescue a reality.
